# piChain

piChain is a library which implements a fault-tolerant distributed state machine that inherits features of Paxos, providing strong consistency, 
and of a blockchain, providing eventual consistency and simplicity. <br/>
For example the library can be used to keep replicas of a distributed data storage consistent in case of failures.
